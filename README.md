# Claude Code Tips & Tricks

## Tip 1: Talk to Claude with Your Voice

I found that you can communicate much faster with your voice than typing with your hands. Using a voice transcription system on your local machine is really helpful for this.

On my Mac, I've tried a few different options:
- [superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com/)
- [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper)
- [Super Voice Assistant](https://github.com/ykdojo/super-voice-assistant)

You can get more accuracy by sending audio to a server API somewhere, but I found that a local model is strong enough for this purpose. Even when there are mistakes or typos in the transcription, Claude is smart enough to understand what you're trying to say. Sometimes you need to say certain things extra clearly, but overall local models work well.
